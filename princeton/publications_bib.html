  abstract = {This paper presents an analytical model and a geometric numerical integrator for a tethered spacecraft model that is composed of two rigid bodies connected by an elastic tether. This model includes important dynamic characteristics of tethered spacecraft in orbit, namely the nonlinear coupling between tether deformations, rotational dynamics of rigid bodies, a reeling mechanism, and orbital dynamics. A geometric numerical integrator, referred to as a Lie group variational integrator, is developed to numerically preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the presented model and its Lie group configuration manifold. The structure-preserving properties are particularly useful for studying complex dynamics of a tethered spacecraft. These properties are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {Linear elasticity problems posed on cracked domains, or domains with re-entrant corners, yield singular solutions that deteriorate the optimality of convergence of finite element methods. In this work, we propose an optimally convergent finite element method for this class of problems. The method is based on approximating a much smoother function obtained by locally reparameterizing the solution around the singularities. This reparameterized solution can be approximated using standard finite element procedures yielding optimal convergence rates for any order of interpolating polynomials, without additional degrees of freedom or special shape functions. Hence the method provides optimally convergent solutions for the same computational complexity of standard finite element methods. Furthermore, the sparsity and the conditioning of the resulting system are preserved. The method handles body forces and crack-face tractions, as well as multiple crack tips and re-entrant corners. The advantages of the method are showcased for four different problems: a straight crack with loaded faces, a circular arc crack, an L-shaped domain undergoing anti-plane deformation, and lastly a crack along a bimaterial interface. Optimality in convergence is observed for all the examples. A proof of optimal convergence is accomplished mainly by proving the regularity of the reparameterized solution.},
